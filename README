Agregado Wordpress Theme
========================
Initial commit was v1.2, downloaded from:
<http://www.darrenhoyt.com/2008/09/08/agregado-lifestream-theme-for-wordpress-released/>

I found this theme while looking to update my WordPress blog, and thought
it would be a good base to build off of. Posting here on github since the
original theme hasn't been updated since 2008, and perhaps other people
might want some bug fixes too.

The licensing is ... strange. `licensecheck -r` finds a BSD 3-clause file,
a GPL-2 file, a bunch of non-licensed files, while the main CSS file just
says "GPL".

Even better, according to:
<http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2008/09/08/agregado-a-free-wordpress-theme/>

> "if you are planning to release your modification, please ask our
> permission first."

Along with a bunch of other GPL-violating text.

I choose to ignore the non-legal text, accept this theme in the spirit of
GPL-2, and consider all my commits under GPL-2 as well.
